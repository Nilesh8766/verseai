In today’s rapidly evolving job market, individuals often face difficulty in making informed career decisions due to the dynamic 
nature of industry requirements, skill gaps, and information overload. Traditional career guidance systems provide generic 
recommendations that fail to adapt to individual user profiles. This paper presents VerseAI, an AI-Based Career 
Recommendation System designed to deliver personalized career insights using artificial intelligence. The system analyzes user
specific data such as skills, experience, and industry preferences to generate tailored career recommendations. VerseAI leverages 
modern full-stack technologies and AI-driven analysis to ensure scalability, accessibility, and efficiency. A small-scale evaluation 
demonstrates the effectiveness of the system in providing relevant and actionable recommendations, highlighting its potential as 
a decision support tool for career planning.
